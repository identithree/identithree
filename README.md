### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Sam!
I'm a 14 year old trans person and write code to escape school. You may use they/them pronouns and you can find a list of what I use [here](https://quinnlane.dev/pronouns.html). I mainly write in Node.js and Typescript however I am learning C/C++ and Rust. I am currently dating the lovely [Kiwiscripter](https://github.com/kiwiscripter), and when I am not talking with him, I am pouring most of my time into a project I am working on called [Pluto](https://github.com/quinndoescode/Pluto) and its base [PlutoCore](https://github.com/quinndoescode/PlutoCore). Pluto is a multipurpose discord bot that will combine multiple bots into one while PlutoCore is a template for making discord bots in discord.js and discord-akairo. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/quinndoescode) and [Discord](https://invite.gg/thesolarsystem). You can also [email](mailto:hello@quinnlane.dev?subject=GitHub%20-%20Hey%20%F0%9F%91%8B&body=Type%20your%20question%2C%20comment%2C%20cool%20pictures%20of%20cats%2C%20etc.%20here.%20You%20also%20might%20want%20to%20change%20the%20subject%20to%20better%20fit%20what%20this%20email%20is%20about.) me.
